                    Imagine you are in a greenhouse, with plants all around you. 
                    Cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers all growing.

                    This is how our world should be. Green, Happy and Healthy. Allowing us to grow
                    and live to our full potential.

                    BUT!!
                    <br>
                    A phenomenon called global warming is making this harder and harder to 
                    do every year. It's making cold places too hot and hot places even hotter!
                </p>

                    This is called the greenhouse affect. We are creating a thicker and thicker
                    greenhouse over the world trapping more and more heat inside.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-part3"></div>
            <h1>Story Part 3</h1>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>
                Imagine being in this greenhouse, you would be hotter than you ever have been before. The plants around you and all the 
                fruit and veg with me struggling to grow.
                <br>
                The Small Modular Reactor program uses nuclear technology in order to help with this problem. It is a form of
                creating electricity. Electricity allows your TVs and Phones to run! This form of electricity generation does
                not cause any of the harmful gases that make the glass on the greenhouse thicker. This means that we can work
                on making the glass thicker leading to a greener and healthier planet for us to live on.
